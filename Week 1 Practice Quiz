#Practice Quiz - Week 1 - Excel Skills for Business - Intermediate II

Step 1:
  Data Validation for no duplicates - Custom
  =COUNTIFS(Student_number,C8)<=1
  
Step 2, 3 and 4:
 Drop Down List - Make a List on separate Sheet (Lists)
 In Lists Sheet, first give a different header name than original sheet -> create named ranges -> convert to a table 
    -- Now go to original Sheet, create data validations -> list -> select names from Lists sheet.
    
Step 6:
  Decimal between 0 and 1
  
Step 7:
  Birth Year NOT to have Students less than 16 YEARS OLD
  Data Validation -> Whole Number -> Data : Less than or equal to
      maximum: =YEAR(TODAY()) - 16            ##HIGHLIGHTS STUDENTS WHO ARE LESS THAN 16 YEARS OLD TODAY.
      
Step 8:
  First Enrolment Date NOT to be MORE THAN TODAY, use CONDITIONAL FORMATTING to highlight FIRST YEAR STUDENTS
    
    Enrolment date to NOT be MORE THAN TODAY: 
    Data Validation -> Date -> Less than or equal to -> =TODAY()
    
    CONDITIONAL FORMATTING to highlight FIRST YEAR STUDENTS:
    
    Home -> Conditional Formatting -> New Rule
    Choose "use formula to determine which cells to format"
      Formula: = ((YEAR(TODAY()) - YEAR(first data under first enrolment date column)) < 1 
          #year as of writing is 2022, therefore, this formula will return students who have completed less than a year, implying they are in first year.
          
Step 9:
  Validate between 0 and 5
  
Step 10:
  Validate to have less than or equal to number of units enrolled.
  Data Validation -> Whole Number -> less than or equal to -> N8
  
Step 11:
  Validate to have less than 30 units.
  
Step 12:
  Validate to have average between 0 and 100
  
Step 13:
  Drop down list for grades.
  Follow Step 2,3,4.
  
Step 14:
  Drop down list for Campus
  Copy and paste drop down list
  
Step 15:
  Count number of students for selected Campus.
  Use COUNTIFS
  
  =COUNTIFS(Campus,S9)
  
Step 16:
  Drop down list for Course
  Copy Paste
  
Step 17:
  Count number of students for selected course
  Follow like in step 15.
  
Step 18:
  Copy Course dropdown
  
Step 19:
  Copy Total grade dropdown
  
Step 20, 21:
  Count number of accounting students with failed grade.
  
  =COUNTIFS(course, Accounting(step 18 cell number), Total grade, Fail(step19 cell num))
  
Step 22:
  Copy Course dropdown
  
Step 23:
  Copy Campus dropdown
  
Step 24, 25:
  Calcualte total payment for courses and campus.
  Use SUMIFS
  
  =SUMIFS(Total_Payments, Course, Step22, Campus, Step23)
